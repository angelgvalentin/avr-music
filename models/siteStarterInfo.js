    name: "JHS Morning Glory V4 Transparent Overdrive Pedal",
    price: 199,
    description:
      "The JHS Morning Glory overdrive pedal adds dirt to your guitar tone without changing its fundamental character. Dialing in your sound with the Morning Glory is a piece of cake, thanks to its straightforward layout. Simply crank the Drive control until you reach your desired level of overdrive, twist the Tone knob to hit the sweet spot, then set your master output level with the Volume knob. A Gain toggle activates a boost mode that yields more power, more low end, and more high-gain sizzle. ",

    name: "PRS John Mayer Silver Sky Electric Guitar Golden Mesa",
    price: 2549,
    description:
      "The PRS Silver Sky was designed by Paul Reed Smith and built to John Mayer's specifications. This vintage-inspired guitar boasts a familiar shape with an eye-catching contrasting tone in its cutaway scoop. Its neck carve, scale length, and fingerboard radius were modeled after John's early-'60s instruments; however, a modified PRS-style headstock and locking tuners propel it firmly into the twenty-first century. Park this axe in front of any tube amp, and its sweet-sounding single-coil pickups will churn out glassy, musical tones with excellent note definition. Beyond that, the Silver Sky includes a bone nut, molded metal jack plate, retooled knobs, custom fret-wire, and PRS's double-action truss rod.",
