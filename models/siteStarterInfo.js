    description:
      "The JHS Morning Glory overdrive pedal adds dirt to your guitar tone without changing its fundamental character. Dialing in your sound with the Morning Glory is a piece of cake, thanks to its straightforward layout. Simply crank the Drive control until you reach your desired level of overdrive, twist the Tone knob to hit the sweet spot, then set your master output level with the Volume knob. A Gain toggle activates a boost mode that yields more power, more low end, and more high-gain sizzle. ",

    description:
      "The PRS Silver Sky was designed by Paul Reed Smith and built to John Mayer's specifications. This vintage-inspired guitar boasts a familiar shape with an eye-catching contrasting tone in its cutaway scoop. Its neck carve, scale length, and fingerboard radius were modeled after John's early-'60s instruments; however, a modified PRS-style headstock and locking tuners propel it firmly into the twenty-first century. Park this axe in front of any tube amp, and its sweet-sounding single-coil pickups will churn out glassy, musical tones with excellent note definition. Beyond that, the Silver Sky includes a bone nut, molded metal jack plate, retooled knobs, custom fret-wire, and PRS's double-action truss rod.",

    price: 999,
    description: `The VOX Custom Series AC15 guitar combo amp is now available with two 12" Celestion G12M Greenback speakers. This "TWIN" enhances the full, "chimey" sound of the AC15C1; and also features the larger spring reverb tank found in the AC30C2. The Custom Series have been updated to include dual channel sound, tremolo circuitry, and footswitching capabilities. True to its past, the AC15C2 "TWIN" relies on three 12AX7 dual triode vacuum tubes in the pre-amp stage, and two EL84 pentode tubes in the power stage.

    Two channels are provided on the AC15C2: Normal and Top Boost. Each channel is equipped with its own Volume control, and the Top Boost channel offers highly interactive Treble and Bass tone controls. This powerful channel pairing provides an abundance of tone-crafting control. Both channels rely on the Tone Cut and Volume controls in the Master section. The Tone Cut control operates in the power stage rather than the preamp stage, allowing an additional degree of tone shaping. The Master Volume control works in conjunction with the individual volumes of each channel to create just the right degree of gain-staging. By balancing the individual and Master volumes, the AC15C2 "TWIN" can deliver the coveted clean VOX "chimey" sound or a powerful overdriven tone - and everything between.
    
    The AC15C2 "TWIN" provides the VOX Classic Tremolo effect, with adjustable controls for both the speed and depth. A Warm Spring Reverb is also included on all Custom Series amps, adding spaciousness to the sound. The optional VFS2 footswitch provides a hands-free method of turning the Reverb and Tremolo effects on and off while performing.`,

    price: 549,
    description: `The G2627T Streamliner Center Block with Bigsby bursts into the modern music era with powerful sound and style. Brash and feedback-resistant, the sleek G2627T is designed for the guitarist who demands more than the mundane from an instrument—more performance, more style and most importantly, more volume—while retaining all you expect from a Gretsch. The Streamliner's sound is driven by its spruce center block and trio of Broad'Tron humbucking pickups. These pickups spawn improved definition with tighter bass response for robust lows, pristine highs and a throaty midrange. A lightweight spruce center block runs the length of the double-cutaway body, reinforcing the top while eliminating undesired feedback for volume-friendly performance on rocking stages. Unlock endless tonal options with the added middle pickup and versatile control layout—a pair of three-way pickup toggle switches engages every pickup combination, while master tone control, master volume control and neck, middle and bridge pickup volume controls allow for complete tonal flexibility.

      A fast-playing 12”-radius laurel fingerboard with pearloid Small Block inlays and 22 medium-jumbo frets sits atop the bound nato neck with a thin “U”-shaped profile—ideal for chord work or fiery riffing. Add some shimmer and expression to your playing with the Bigsby-licensed B70 vibrato tailpiece, while the anchored Adjusto-Matic bridge and synthetic bone nut grant astounding tuning stability and accurate, slip-free intonation.
      
      All the classic eye-catching style you've come to expect from Gretsch is here—vintage-style black control knobs, unique cateye f-holes, elegant aged white binding, slick-looking nickel or gold hardware (depending on finish), black pickguard and arched laminated maple construction. Nearly impossible to put down once you pick it up, the G2627T Streamliner has the updated sound and classic style that has earned Gretsch accolades since the dawn of rock 'n' roll.`,
